					<strong>A Sample Of Our Previous Victories</strong>
				</h2>
<!-- 				<p>At Brooklyn's West Indian Day Parade, a 30-year-old father was alleged to have thrown a loaded, semiautomatic firearm to the ground in direct view of an NYPD officer. The client faced three and a half to 15 years' imprisonment, with no alternatives to incarceration. In his investigation, Mr. Moore discovered the arresting officer's membership in Facebook group called &quot;No More West Indian Day Parade,&quot; in which NYPD officers invoked racial slurs and profanity in describing Brooklyn's Caribbean-American community. Over the prosecutor's objection, Mr. Moore successfully argued for and gained admission into evidence of the officer's Facebook page, and the client was acquitted of all charges. The &quot;Facebook Cops&quot; scandal shocked the city, and was featured on the front page of the New York Times, CNN, and news outlets across the world. Client was acquitted of all charges.</p> -->
				<hr />
				<p>Client charged with attempted murder for allegedly shooting an acquaintance at Brooklyn's Wet Fete Festival. Despite testimony by five witnesses and medical evidence, Mr. Zeman convinced the jury to follow the law and acquit his client of all charges.</p>
				<hr />
				<p>Young client being detained at the 84th Precinct was charged with assaulting numerous officers while being handcuffed to a bench. Although the Captain of the precinct and former Police Commissioner Ray Kelly were personally involved in the &quot;investigation,&quot; Mr. Womble convinced the jury that this was not an assault but police cover up. His client was found not guilty of all charges, and he walked out of court a free man.</p>
				<hr />
				<p>Client arrested and charged with selling crack cocaine to an undercover police officer. Prerecorded money and drugs were allegedly found on the client at the time of arrest. At arraignment Mr. Zeman was able to successfully argue for the client's release and the case was dismissed within months.</p>
				<hr />
				<!-- <p>Client charged with home invasion, burglary and robbery facing mandatory life sentence if convicted. At trial, Mr. Moore confronted the accuser with recorded conversation in which she told a different story than the one she had told the jury. Found not guilty of all charges, client walked out of courtroom a free man after over two years on Rikers Island.</p> -->
				<hr />
				<p>Client charged with attempted murder for allegedly shooting the complainant in the face in broad daylight. Mr. Womble hired an expert to examine the accuser's medical records and discovered that it was impossible for his injuries to have been caused by bullets. Following Mr. Womble's aggressive opening statement, the DA decided to dismiss all charges, and the client was released.</p>
				<hr />
				<!-- <p>Client charged with sexual abuse facing life in prison. Mr. Moore adopted reasonable doubt defense that convinced jurors to give client a fair trial by jury, despite the nature of the allegations. The jury found client not guilty of all felonies, and after 27 months in jail, client walked out of courtroom with his attorneys.</p> -->
				<hr />
				<p>Client was previously convicted of attempted robbery following a trial. After spending over two years in prison, the conviction was overturned on appeal. At the second trial, Mr. Womble exposed recorded communications between the officers on the day of the robbery, which said that the victim had been robbed by a man with blonde hair. The client had jet black hair. The jury acquitted the client of all charges in less than half an hour.</p>
				<hr />
				<p>Client charged with attempted murder for allegedly shooting his nephew in their home after an argument. Despite only the nephew and Mr. Zeman's client having been present at the scene and the fact that the nephew had been shot twice; by destroying the credibility of the complaining witness and lead detective, Mr. Zeman convinced the jury that the complainant had shot himself (twice). His client was found not guilty of all charges.</p>
				<hr />
				<!-- <p>When ACS got involved in her life, Mr. Moore accompanied his client to the Special Victims Squad and protected her right to remain silent. Initially charged with a felony, the DA's office reduced the case to a misdemeanor.</p> -->
				<hr />
				<p>Client charged with committing a gunpoint robbery. After another lawyer tried the case and the jury was unable to reach a verdict, Mr. Zeman took over and relitigated the case. During the trial, Mr. Zeman effectively exposed the difference between a mere accusation and proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and the jury found his client not guilty of all charges in less than an hour.</p>
				<hr />
				<p>Client was charged with serious assault after 'snapping' and burning her child with a pot of boiling water. Following months of advocacy and negotiations, Mr. Womble finally convinced the DA to allow his client to engage in an intensive, family-centered program instead of facing years in jail. She passed the program with flying colors, was reunited with her children and her case was dismissed.</p>
