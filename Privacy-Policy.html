<p>This privacy policy applies to information collected online  from users of this website. In this policy, you can learn what kind of  information we collect, when and how we might use that information, how we  protect the information, and the choices you have with respect to your personal  information.</p>
<h3>What personal information is collected through this website  and how is it used?</h3>
<p>We collect information  about our users in three ways: directly  from the user, from our Web server logs and through cookies. We use the  information primarily to provide you with a personalized Internet experience  that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant  and helpful to you. We don't share any of the information you provide with  others, unless we say so in this Privacy Policy, or when we believe in good  faith that the law requires it.</p>
<p><strong>User-supplied information</strong>: If you fill out the &ldquo;contact&rdquo; form on this website, we will ask you to provide some personal information (such as e-mail address, name, phone number and state).  We only require that you provide an e-mail address on the contact form. Further, if chat is available through this site, you may be asked to provide information if you participate in an online chat. Please do not submit any confidential, proprietary or sensitive personally identifiable information (e.g. Social Security Number; date of birth; drivers license number; or credit card, bank account or other financial information) (collectively, "Sensitive Information"). If you submit any Sensitive Information, you do so at your own risk and we will not be liable to you or responsible for consequences of your submission.</p>
<p>Information that you provide to us through the contact form or an online chat will be used so that we may respond to your inquiry. We may also use information you provide to us to communicate with you in the future. If you do not wish to receive such communications, you may opt out (unsubscribe) as described below.</p>
<p><strong>Web server logs</strong>: When you visit our website, we may track information about your visit and store that information in web server logs, which are records of the activities on our sites. The servers automatically capture and save the information electronically. Examples of the information we may collect include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>your unique Internet protocol address; </li>
	<li>the name of your unique Internet service provider; </li>
	<li>the town/city, county/state and country from which you access our website; </li>
	<li>the kind of browser or computer you use; </li>
	<li>the number of links you click within the site; </li>
	<li>the date and time of your visit; </li>
	<li>the web page from which you arrived to our site; </li>
	<li>the pages you viewed on the site; and </li>
	<li>certain searches/queries that you conducted via our website(s). </li>
</ul>
<p>The  information we collect in web server logs helps us administer the site, analyze  its usage, protect the website and its content from inappropriate use and  improve the user's experience.</p>
