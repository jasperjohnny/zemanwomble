            <div class="attorneyProfileNarrative">
                <br /><p>I have over a decade of experience in the courts of New York.  I have represented thousands of clients from every walk of life. Every case and every client is different. Every case requires a unique strategy. Every client deserves an honest attorney.</p>

                <p>An important part of my job is making sure that my clients fully understand their case and their rights. I do everything I can to make sure that whatever decision the client makes, no question is left unanswered.&nbsp; Getting your case right will always be my highest priority.</p>

                <p>If getting it right means going to trial, you will have an experienced and successful trial attorney in that court room. If getting it right means working out a disposition that allows you to move on with your life, I will work with you to achieve that goal. I have gone toe to toe with cops, prosecutors, prisons and the government, to protect the rights and lives of my clients.</p>

                <p>I have spent my career fighting injustice and I have written extensively about what I have witnessed inside the criminal justice system. My articles include:</p>
