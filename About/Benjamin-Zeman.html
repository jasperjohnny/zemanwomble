                <br /><p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;I am a free man today because of Mr. Zeman.&rdquo;</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">In nearly a decade as a criminal defense attorney and litigator I have represented a wide range of clients including doctors, scientists, artists, business owners, teachers, pastors, rabbis, students, parents, musicians, producers and athletes.   </p><p class="MsoNormal">No matter what you have been accused of or what injustice you may be confronting, my flair for the dramatic and uncanny ability to earn acquittals in the toughest cases have cemented my reputation as one of the best trial attorneys in Brooklyn and New York City.  </p><p class="MsoNormal">As a public defender, I fought for thousands of people charged with every level of crime and have a deep and thorough understanding of just how the court systems work. I also have first-hand experience with how the government and other powerful interests can take advantage and destroy the lives of people who are not properly represented. My profound distrust for authority has guided my passionate defense of those accused of crimes and relentless advocacy for individuals who wish to fight powerful government and corporate entities. If you are fighting the state, the government, or have been harmed by an entity that seems too big to confront, I want to go to battle for you.   </p><p class="MsoNormal">As a life-long athlete, performer and competitor, I have translated this unique combination of skills into every sort of trial victory. I am known throughout New York City as both a diplomatic negotiator and an exceptionally skilled trial attorney. My practice style is marked by exhaustive pretrial preparation and a smothering pressure inside the courtroom.  </p><p class="MsoNormal">My litigation skills have been recognized by colleagues, adversaries, and educators and I hold a faculty position at Brooklyn Law School, where I teach trial advocacy to aspiring future attorneys.   </p><p class="MsoNormal">If you or someone you know needs representation do not hesitate. Call 718-514-9100 or email me at zeman@brooklynattorney.nyc for a free consultation, anytime of the day or night.   </p><p class="MsoNormal">Let&rsquo;s do this.  </p>
