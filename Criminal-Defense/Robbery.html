        <p>If you are facing robbery charges, the potential consequences you face are determined by a variety of aspects of the case. For example:</p><ul><li>Was someone injured who was not part of the robbery?</li><li>Were the injuries severe?</li><li>Did you have a firearm at the time?</li><li>Was a firearm brandished or displayed?</li><li>Was the property that was taken a motor vehicle?</li></ul><p>A strong defense begins by closely examining the charges and the evidence. We will look for all evidence that will help refute the prosecution's version of what happened.
