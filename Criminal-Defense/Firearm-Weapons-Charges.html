        <p>Are you facing weapons charges for possessing a firearm? In New York City there is almost no licensing of people to carry firearms. Most likely, if the police stop you and you have a gun, you will be facing charges whether you used that gun in the commission of a crime or not.</p><p>Gun crimes in New York fall into a small number of categories, including:</p><ul><li> <strong>Criminal use of a firearm</strong> — This charge involves committing another crime while possessing or displaying some sort of firearm. </li><li> <strong>Criminal possession of a weapon</strong> — This can be charged as a misdemeanor or felony depending on the facts of the situation. It can carry a maximum prison sentence of up to 25 years. </li></ul><h2>Licensed In Your State, Illegal In New York</h2><p>Many people do not realize that the permit they have to carry a gun in their home state does not allow them to possess a firearm in New York City.
