        <p>Drug charges carry some of the most severe consequences of any nonviolent crime, including substantial prison sentences. Beyond prison, a drug conviction can have a dramatic impact on people's lives, especially young people such as college students.</p><p>A drug conviction can prevent a person from having access to financial aid for college. It can also follow someone for years on their criminal record. Having a drug conviction on your criminal record can create problems securing employment or a lease.</p><h2>Alternatives To Conviction</h2><p>Many of those facing drug charges have never had any involvement with the criminal justice system before. The courts have begun to recognize this and there are now alternative programs such as treatment courts and judicial diversion that can allow individuals to get help regarding their drug use while avoiding having a criminal conviction on their record. These programs are not open to everyone. We can help you pursue the right resolution for your individual case.</p><p>We defend anyone facing criminal charges related to:</p><ul><li>Cocaine</li><li>Marijuana</li><li>Heroin</li><li>Prescription drugs</li><li>Crack</li><li>Methamphetamine</li></ul><h2>Experienced Lawyers â€” Ready To Fight For You</h2><p>At <a href="/About/index.html">Zeman & Womble, LLP</a>, our firm is skilled at fighting drug charges.
