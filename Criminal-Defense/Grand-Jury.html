        <p>In New York, being arrested on felony charges include having your charges brought before a Grand Jury to determine if there is sufficient evidence to go to trial. In some situations this is a great opportunity to begin fighting against criminal charges. In most cases, however, the reality is that testifying before the Grand Jury can do more harm than good.</p><p class="callOut">Deciding whether or not to testify before the Grand Jury is a difficult choice. We can help you understand what it means for you.</p><p>A Grand Jury is a very prosecutor-friendly environment. The prosecutor has a great degree of control over what transpires in front of a Grand Jury. Depending on the case, this can mean that nothing will be gained from testifying before the Grand Jury. In fact, it can actually damage your case. The prosecutor can see what your defense strategy is, for example. And anything you say can be used against you in the future.</p><h2>Experienced Lawyers â€” Ready To Fight For You</h2><p>At <a href="/About/index.html">Zeman & Womble, LLP</a>, we can help you understand the Grand Jury process and how it can benefit or hurt your case.
